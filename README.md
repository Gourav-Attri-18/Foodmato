# Foodmato
Foodmato is a frontend-only web application built using React.js. It is designed to mimic the core functionality of Zomato, a popular food delivery platform. The project focuses on delivering a seamless and responsive user interface for searching and discovering restaurants, viewing menus, and placing orders (frontend-only).
